<p>Hi! My name is Caleb White and this is my third semester up at BYUI! I'm new to my computer science major, but I'm excited for what's to come!</p>
<p>I'm a homebody, so in my free time I enjoy watching movies/shows and listening to music!</p>
<p>I recently returned from my mission in Colorado Springs and it was an incredible experience!</p>
<p>My favorite scripture is Isaiah 41:10 because it talks about trusting God and not having fear.</p>
